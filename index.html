                    and the Van der Linde gang are forced to flee. With federal agents and the best 
                    bounty hunters in the nation massing on their heels, the gang must rob, steal and 
                    fight their way across the rugged heartland of America in order to survive. As 
                    deepening internal divisions threaten to tear the gang apart, Arthur must make a 
                    choice between his own ideals and loyalty to the gang who raised him.</p>

                    Over 50 unique usable weapons, a massive range of options for customization, 
                    and a wide selection of different ammunition types to improve accuracy, range or damage.<br> 
                    The more a gun is used, the better it will perform, but it will also start to degrade over time if 
                    not looked after, so a trusty sidearm needs to be kept oiled and clean.</p>

                            <p>The new Lancaster Repeater is of sound construction intended to prevent
                                snow, rain, pineneedles, tobacco dust, sand, cow excrement and other 
                                debris from entering the shooting chamber. It is the gun that won both
                                the West and the South from the ne'er-do-wells. A wise man once said
                                "it is better to keep your mouth closed and your Lancaster at the ready,
                                in case you have to shoot off either."
